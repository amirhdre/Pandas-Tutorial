# Pandas Tutorial

This repository contains useful notebooks about Pandas library. Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. Started by Wes McKinney in 2008 out of a need for a powerful and flexible quantitative analysis tool, pandas has grown into one of the most popular Python libraries. 

Pandas is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code

 Pandas introduced two new types of objects for storing data that make analytical tasks easier and eliminate the need to switch tools: Series, which have a list-like structure, and DataFrames, which have a tabular structure.
